# StudBud

The most major changes done to this prototype, comapared to the web pitch is teh layout of teh site. 

Taking into consideration both my coding skills and the limited time, I made the decision to change the layout of Studbud to place each elemnet in its own separate page, similar to one of the earlier iterations of the site that I discussed in the pitch.

Using the functional specification list, I tried to include most of the *High Priority* functions that should be included in teh application. However unfortunately, due to both my lack of skill and time to work on this project, I had to make the decision to omit some functions of the app. Ultimately, I had to decide which tasks were of *most* importance to both my target audience, as well as the design brief.

For the kanban board, I kept the option for users to drag and drop tasks within the columns, as well as add and delete new tasks. Users can also drag tasks between each other in columns, to rank the level of priority themselves. I found that these were some of the most crucial elements in the task, which I wanted to include. However, as a result, I wasnt able to include secondary actions such as the due date, estimated time and colour coding of tasks that I had wanted to during my pitch.
